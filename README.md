# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My main idea I have has to do with the game "Minesweeper". I enjoy playing the game in my free time and it's not a common game that many people know how to play from what I see. I want to create a twist on minesweeper and add some powerups/abilities that can help you solve the game. Since there are many times where you have to guess where a mine is, some abilities I have in mind already is one that could show you if there's a mine where you plan to click. I'd think of more while working on it, but this is a general idea I have for now. Another idea I have in mind is maybe a discord music bot I could use in my personal discord servers with my friends.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work on this project solo.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I was wondering if anyone in the past did a project about Minesweeper and if they did, were there any struggles they had on it. If not, I was wondering if you think this idea is too easy or too difficult.
